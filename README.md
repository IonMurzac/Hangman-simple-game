# Hangman-simple-game
This is a code for a word guessing game written in python. The game randomly selects a word from a list of words and the player has to guess the letters of the word one by one. The game will give feedback to the player whether the guessed letter is present in the word or not. If the letter is present in the word then it will be revealed in the word, otherwise the player loses one attempt. The player has 8 attempts to guess the correct word. If the player guesses the correct word or runs out of attempts, the game ends. The game also uses ascii art to display a hangman with the number of attempts remaining.
